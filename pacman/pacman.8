.SH "NAME"
pacman \- package manager utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fIpacman\fR <operation> [options] [targets]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Pacman is a package management utility that tracks installed packages on a Linux system\&. It features dependency support, package groups, install and uninstall hooks, and the ability to sync your local machine with a remote ftp server to automatically upgrade packages\&. Pacman packages are a zipped tar format\&.
.sp
Since version 3\&.0\&.0, pacman has been the frontend to \fBlibalpm\fR(3), the \(lqArch Linux Package Management\(rq library\&. This library allows alternative front ends to be written (for instance, a GUI front end)\&.
.sp
Invoking pacman involves specifying an operation with any potential options and targets to operate on\&. A \fItarget\fR is usually a package name, filename, URL, or a search string\&. Targets can be provided as command line arguments\&. Additionally, if a single dash (\-) is passed as an argument, targets will be read from stdin\&.
.SH "OPERATIONS"
.PP
\fB\-D, \-\-database\fR
.RS 4
Modify the package database\&. This operation allows you to modify certain attributes of the installed packages in pacman\(cqs database\&. At the moment, you can only change the install reason using
\fI\-\-asdeps\fR
and
\fI\-\-asexplicit\fR
options\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-Q, \-\-query\fR
.RS 4
Query the package database\&. This operation allows you to view installed packages and their files, as well as meta\-information about individual packages (dependencies, conflicts, install date, build date, size)\&. This can be run against the local package database or can be used on individual
\fI\&.tar\&.gz\fR
packages\&. In the first case, if no package names are provided in the command line, all installed packages will be queried\&. Additionally, various filters can be applied on the package list\&. See
Query Options
below\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-R, \-\-remove\fR
.RS 4
Remove package(s) from the system\&. Groups can also be specified to be removed, in which case every package in that group will be removed\&. Files belonging to the specified package will be deleted, and the database will be updated\&. Most configuration files will be saved with a
\fI\&.pacsave\fR
extension unless the
\fI\-\-nosave\fR
option is used\&. See
Remove Options
below\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-S, \-\-sync\fR
.RS 4
Synchronize packages\&. Packages are installed directly from the ftp servers, including all dependencies required to run the packages\&. For example,
pacman \-S qt
will download and install qt and all the packages it depends on\&. If a package name exists in more than one repo, the repo can be explicitly specified to clarify the package to install:
pacman \-S testing/qt\&. You can also specify version requirements:
pacman \-S "bash>=3\&.2"\&. (Quotes are needed, otherwise your shell interprets ">" as redirection to file\&.)
.sp
In addition to packages, groups can be specified as well\&. For example, if gnome is a defined package group, then
pacman \-S gnome
will provide a prompt allowing you to select which packages to install from a numbered list\&. The package selection is specified using a space separated list of package numbers\&. Sequential packages may be selected by specifying the first and last package numbers separated by a hyphen (\-)\&. Excluding packages is achieved by prefixing a number or range of numbers with a caret (^)\&.
.sp
Packages that provide other packages are also handled\&. For example,
pacman \-S foo
will first look for a foo package\&. If foo is not found, packages that provide the same functionality as foo will be searched for\&. If any package is found, it will be installed\&. A selection prompt is provided if multiple packages providing foo are found\&.
.sp
You can also use
pacman \-Su
to upgrade all packages that are out of date\&. See
Sync Options
below\&. When upgrading, pacman performs version comparison to determine which packages need upgrading\&. This behavior operates as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Alphanumeric:
  1\&.0a < 1\&.0b < 1\&.0beta < 1\&.0p < 1\&.0pre < 1\&.0rc < 1\&.0 < 1\&.0\&.a < 1\&.0\&.1
Numeric:
  1 < 1\&.0 < 1\&.1 < 1\&.1\&.1 < 1\&.2 < 2\&.0 < 3\&.0\&.0
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Additionally, version strings can have an
\fIepoch\fR
value defined that will overrule any version comparison (unless the epoch values are equal)\&. This is specified in an
epoch:version\-rel
format\&. For example,
2:1\&.0\-1
is always greater than
1:3\&.6\-1\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-T, \-\-deptest\fR
.RS 4
Check dependencies; this is useful in scripts such as makepkg to check installed packages\&. This operation will check each dependency specified and return a list of dependencies that are not currently satisfied on the system\&. This operation accepts no other options\&. Example usage:
pacman \-T qt "bash>=3\&.2"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-U, \-\-upgrade\fR
.RS 4
Upgrade or add package(s) to the system and install the required dependencies from sync repos\&. Either a URL or file path can be specified\&. This is a \(lqremove\-then\-add\(rq process\&. See
Upgrade Options
below; also see
Handling Config Files
for an explanation on how pacman takes care of config files\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V, \-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Display version and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Display syntax for the given operation\&. If no operation was supplied then the general syntax is shown\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-b, \-\-dbpath\fR <path>
.RS 4
Specify an alternative database location (a typical default is
/var/lib/pacman)\&. This should not be used unless you know what you are doing\&.
\fBNOTE\fR: if specified, this is an absolute path and the root path is not automatically prepended\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r, \-\-root\fR <path>
.RS 4
Specify an alternative installation root (default is
/)\&. This should not be used as a way to install software into
/usr/local
instead of
/usr\&. This option is used if you want to install a package on a temporary mounted partition that is "owned" by another system\&.
\fBNOTE\fR: if database path or logfile are not specified on either the command line or in
\fBpacman.conf\fR(5), their default location will be inside this root path\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Output paths such as as the Root, Conf File, DB Path, Cache Dirs, etc\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-arch\fR <arch>
.RS 4
Specify an alternate architecture\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cachedir\fR <dir>
.RS 4
Specify an alternative package cache location (a typical default is
/var/cache/pacman/pkg)\&. Multiple cache directories can be specified, and they are tried in the order they are passed to pacman\&.
\fBNOTE\fR: this is an absolute path, the root path is not automatically prepended\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-config\fR <file>
.RS 4
Specify an alternate configuration file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
.RS 4
Display debug messages\&. When reporting bugs, this option is recommended to be used\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-gpgdir\fR <dir>
.RS 4
Specify a directory of files used by GnuPG to verify package signatures (a typical default is
/etc/pacman\&.d/gnupg)\&. This directory should contain two files:
pubring\&.gpg
and
trustdb\&.gpg\&.
pubring\&.gpg
holds the public keys of all packagers\&.
trustdb\&.gpg
contains a so\-called trust database, which specifies that the keys are authentic and trusted\&.
\fBNOTE\fR: this is an absolute path, the root path is not automatically prepended\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-logfile\fR <file>
.RS 4
Specify an alternate log file\&. This is an absolute path, regardless of the installation root setting\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-noconfirm\fR
.RS 4
Bypass any and all \(lqAre you sure?\(rq messages\&. It\(cqs not a good idea to do this unless you want to run pacman from a script\&.
.RE
.SH "TRANSACTION OPTIONS (APPLY TO \FI\-S\FR, \FI\-R\FR AND \FI\-U\FR)"
.PP
\fB\-d, \-\-nodeps\fR
.RS 4
Skips dependency version checks\&. Package names are still checked\&. Normally, pacman will always check a package\(cqs dependency fields to ensure that all dependencies are installed and there are no package conflicts in the system\&. Specify this option twice to skip all dependency checks\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-dbonly\fR
.RS 4
Adds/Removes the database entry only, leaves all files in place\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-noprogressbar\fR
.RS 4
Do not show a progress bar when downloading files\&. This can be useful for scripts that call pacman and capture the output\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-noscriptlet\fR
.RS 4
If an install scriptlet exists, do not execute it\&. Do not use this unless you know what you are doing\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p, \-\-print\fR
.RS 4
Only print the targets instead of performing the actual operation (sync, remove or upgrade)\&. Use
\fI\-\-print\-format\fR
to specify how targets are displayed\&. The default format string is "%l", which displays URLs with
\fI\-S\fR, filenames with
\fI\-U\fR
and pkgname\-pkgver with
\fI\-R\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-print\-format\fR <format>
.RS 4
Specify a printf\-like format to control the output of the
\fI\-\-print\fR
operation\&. The possible attributes are: %n for pkgname, %v for pkgver, %l for location, %r for repo and %s for size\&.
.RE
.SH "UPGRADE OPTIONS (APPLY TO \FI\-S\FR AND \FI\-U\FR)"
.PP
\fB\-f, \-\-force\fR
.RS 4
Bypass file conflict checks and overwrite conflicting files\&. If the package that is about to be installed contains files that are already installed, this option will cause all those files to be overwritten\&. This option should be used with care, ideally not at all\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-asdeps\fR
.RS 4
Install packages non\-explicitly; in other words, fake their install reason to be installed as a dependency\&. This is useful for makepkg and other build from source tools that need to install dependencies before building the package\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-asexplicit\fR
.RS 4
Install packages explicitly; in other words, fake their install reason to be explicitly installed\&. This is useful if you want to mark a dependency as explicitly installed so it will not be removed by the
\fI\-\-recursive\fR
remove operation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ignore\fR <package>
.RS 4
Directs pacman to ignore upgrades of package even if there is one available\&. Multiple packages can be specified by separating them with a comma\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ignoregroup\fR <group>
.RS 4
Directs pacman to ignore upgrades of all packages in
\fIgroup\fR
even if there is one available\&. Multiple groups can be specified by separating them with a comma\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-needed\fR
.RS 4
Do not reinstall the targets that are already up to date\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-recursive\fR
.RS 4
Recursively reinstall all dependencies of the targets\&. This forces upgrades or reinstalls of all dependencies without requiring explicit version requirements\&. This is most useful in combination with the
\fI\-\-needed\fR
flag, which will induce a deep dependency upgrade without any unnecessary reinstalls\&.
.RE
.SH "QUERY OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-c, \-\-changelog\fR
.RS 4
View the ChangeLog of a package if it exists\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d, \-\-deps\fR
.RS 4
Restrict or filter output to packages installed as dependencies\&. This option can be combined with
\fI\-t\fR
for listing real orphans \- packages that were installed as dependencies but are no longer required by any installed package\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e, \-\-explicit\fR
.RS 4
Restrict or filter output to explicitly installed packages\&. This option can be combined with
\fI\-t\fR
to list explicitly installed packages that are not required by any other package\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-g, \-\-groups\fR
.RS 4
Display all packages that are members of a named group\&. If a name is not specified, list all grouped packages\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i, \-\-info\fR
.RS 4
Display information on a given package\&. The
\fI\-p\fR
option can be used if querying a package file instead of the local database\&. Passing two
\fI\-\-info\fR
or
\fI\-i\fR
flags will also display the list of backup files and their modification states\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-k \-\-check\fR
.RS 4
Check that all files owned by the given package(s) are present on the system\&. If packages are not specified or filter flags are not provided, check all installed packages\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l, \-\-list\fR
.RS 4
List all files owned by a given package\&. Multiple packages can be specified on the command line\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-m, \-\-foreign\fR
.RS 4
Restrict or filter output to packages that were not found in the sync database(s)\&. Typically these are packages that were downloaded manually and installed with
\fI\-\-upgrade\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o, \-\-owns\fR <file>
.RS 4
Search for packages that own the specified file(s)\&. The path can be relative or absolute and one or more files can be specified\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p, \-\-file\fR
.RS 4
Signifies that the package supplied on the command line is a file and not an entry in the database\&. The file will be decompressed and queried\&. This is useful in combination with
\fI\-\-info\fR
and
\fI\-\-list\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-q, \-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Show less information for certain query operations\&. (This is useful when pacman\(cqs output is processed in a script\&.) Search will only show package names and not version, group, and description information; owns will only show package names instead of "file is owned by pkg" messages; group will only show package names and omit group names; list will only show files and omit package names; check will only show pairs of package names and missing files; a bare query will only show package names rather than names and versions\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s, \-\-search\fR <regexp>
.RS 4
Search each locally\-installed package for names or descriptions that match
regexp\&. When including multiple search terms, only packages with descriptions matching ALL of those terms are returned\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t, \-\-unrequired\fR
.RS 4
Restrict or filter output to packages not required by any currently installed package\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-u, \-\-upgrades\fR
.RS 4
Restrict or filter output to packages that are out of date on the local system\&. (Only package versions are used to find outdated packages, replacements are not checked here\&.) This option works best if the sync database is refreshed using
\fI\-Sy\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "REMOVE OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-c, \-\-cascade\fR
.RS 4
Remove all target packages, as well as all packages that depend on one or more target packages\&. This operation is recursive, and must be used with care since it can remove many potentially needed packages\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-n, \-\-nosave\fR
.RS 4
Instructs pacman to ignore file backup designations\&. Normally, when a file is removed from the system the database is checked to see if the file should be renamed with a
\fI\&.pacsave\fR
extension\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s, \-\-recursive\fR
.RS 4
Remove each target specified including all of their dependencies, provided that (A) they are not required by other packages; and (B) they were not explicitly installed by the user\&. This operation is recursive and analogous to a backwards
\fI\-\-sync\fR
operation, and helps keep a clean system without orphans\&. If you want to omit condition (B), pass this option twice\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-u, \-\-unneeded\fR
.RS 4
Removes targets that are not required by any other packages\&. This is mostly useful when removing a group without using the
\fI\-c\fR
option, to avoid breaking any dependencies\&.
.RE
.SH "SYNC OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-c, \-\-clean\fR
.RS 4
Remove packages that are no longer installed from the cache as well as currently unused sync databases to free up disk space\&. When pacman downloads packages, it saves them in a cache directory\&. In addition, databases are saved for every sync DB you download from, and are not deleted even if they are removed from the configuration file
\fBpacman.conf\fR(5)\&. Use one
\fI\-\-clean\fR
switch to only remove packages that are no longer installed; use two to remove all files from the cache\&. In both cases, you will have a yes or no option to remove packages and/or unused downloaded databases\&.
.sp
If you use a network shared cache, see the
\fICleanMethod\fR
option in
\fBpacman.conf\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-g, \-\-groups\fR
.RS 4
Display all the members for each package group specified\&. If no group names are provided, all groups will be listed; pass the flag twice to view all groups and their members\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i, \-\-info\fR
.RS 4
Display information on a given sync database package\&. Passing two
\fI\-\-info\fR
or
\fI\-i\fR
flags will also display those packages in all repositories that depend on this package\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l, \-\-list\fR
.RS 4
List all packages in the specified repositories\&. Multiple repositories can be specified on the command line\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-q, \-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Show less information for certain sync operations\&. (This is useful when pacman\(cqs output is processed in a script\&.) Search will only show package names and not repo, version, group, and description information; list will only show package names and omit databases and versions; group will only show package names and omit group names\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s, \-\-search\fR <regexp>
.RS 4
This will search each package in the sync databases for names or descriptions that match
regexp\&. When you include multiple search terms, only packages with descriptions matching ALL of those terms will be returned\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-u, \-\-sysupgrade\fR
.RS 4
Upgrades all packages that are out of date\&. Each currently\-installed package will be examined and upgraded if a newer package exists\&. A report of all packages to upgrade will be presented and the operation will not proceed without user confirmation\&. Dependencies are automatically resolved at this level and will be installed/upgraded if necessary\&.
.sp
Pass this option twice to enable package downgrade; in this case pacman will select sync packages whose version does not match with the local version\&. This can be useful when the user switches from a testing repo to a stable one\&.
.sp
Additional targets can also be specified manually, so that
\fI\-Su foo\fR
will do a system upgrade and install/upgrade the foo package in the same operation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-w, \-\-downloadonly\fR
.RS 4
Retrieve all packages from the server, but do not install/upgrade anything\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-y, \-\-refresh\fR
.RS 4
Download a fresh copy of the master package list from the server(s) defined in
\fBpacman.conf\fR(5)\&. This should typically be used each time you use
\fI\-\-sysupgrade\fR
or
\fI\-u\fR\&. Passing two
\fI\-\-refresh\fR
or
\fI\-y\fR
flags will force a refresh of all package lists even if they appear to be up to date\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-needed\fR
.RS 4
Do not reinstall the targets that are already up to date\&.
.RE
.SH "HANDLING CONFIG FILES"
.sp
Pacman uses the same logic as rpm to determine action against files that are designated to be backed up\&. During an upgrade, 3 md5 hashes are used for each backup file to determine the required action: one for the original file installed, one for the new file that\(cqs about to be installed, and one for the actual file existing on the filesystem\&. After comparing these 3 hashes, the follow scenarios can result:
.PP
original=X, current=X, new=X
.RS 4
All three files are the same, so overwrites are not an issue\&. Install the new file\&.
.RE
.PP
original=X, current=X, new=Y
.RS 4
The current file is the same as the original but the new one differs\&. Since the user did not ever modify the file, and the new one may contain improvements or bugfixes, install the new file\&.
.RE
.PP
original=X, current=Y, new=X
.RS 4
Both package versions contain the exact same file, but the one on the filesystem has been modified\&. Leave the current file in place\&.
.RE
.PP
original=X, current=Y, new=Y
.RS 4
The new file is identical to the current file\&. Install the new file\&.
.RE
.PP
original=X, current=Y, new=Z
.RS 4
All three files are different, so install the new file with a
\fI\&.pacnew\fR
extension and warn the user\&. The user must then manually merge any necessary changes into the original file\&.
